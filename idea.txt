Project: Advanced Linux Server Backup and Monitoring System
Objective:
To create a robust bash script that automates backups of critical directories on a Linux server and monitors system resources such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and network activity.

Flowchart:

Start
|
|---> Setup Backup Configuration
|       |
|       |---> Define Backup Directory
|       |
|       |---> Specify Directories to Backup
|       |
|       |---> Set Backup Schedule
|       |
|       |---> Configure Backup Retention Policy
|
|---> Perform Backup
|       |
|       |---> Create Backup Archive
|       |
|       |---> Verify Backup Integrity
|       |
|       |---> Rotate Old Backups According to Retention Policy
|
|---> Monitor System Resources
|       |
|       |---> Check CPU Usage
|       |
|       |---> Check Memory Usage
|       |
|       |---> Check Disk Usage
|       |
|       |---> Check Network Activity
|
|---> Generate Reports/Alerts
|       |
|       |---> Send Email Alert if Resource Thresholds Exceeded
|       |
|       |---> Log Resource Usage to File
|
End

Key Features:
- Backup Configuration:
    User-configurable settings for specifying backup directory, directories to backup, backup schedule, and retention policy.

- Backup Process:
    Script will create compressed backup archives of specified directories.

- Verify backup integrity after completion.
    Implement rotation of old backups based on the defined retention policy.

- System Monitoring:
    Regularly monitor system resources including CPU, memory, disk usage, and network activity.

- Alerting Mechanism:
    Send email alerts to specified recipients if system resource thresholds are exceeded (e.g., high CPU usage, low disk space).
    Log resource usage data to a file for historical analysis.

- Additional Considerations:
    Error handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and failures during backup and monitoring processes.
    Logging: Utilize logging extensively to track script execution, backup operations, and system monitoring activities.
    Security: Ensure that sensitive information such as email credentials or backup contents are handled securely and follow best practices for permissions and access control.

This project will require a deep understanding of bash scripting fundamentals, system administration concepts, and Linux command-line tools. 
Additionally, it offers opportunities for further enhancement and customization based on specific requirements and preferences.
